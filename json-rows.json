called sleep apnea these two words should be emblazoned in the minds of every snorer and anyone who lives with or cares about the safety and well being of a snorer the word apnea in the term sleep apnea derives from the greek term for absence of breathing that in a nutshell gives a sense of how dangerous sleep apnea can be it literally refers to a condition where breathing stops during sleep there are two types of sleep apnea obstructive sleep apnea osa  this most common form of apnea occurs when throat muscles relax central sleep apnea  this form of apnea occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing sleep apnea and snoring are directly linked because during snoring the airway of the trachea is constantly subjected to repetitive collapse and obstruction in fact it is that collapse and obstruction that leads to the vibration that ultimately manifests itself as audible snoring obstructive sleep apnea thus occurs when due to that continuous collapse of the airway breathing actually stops although obstructive sleep apnea occurs two to three times as often in older male adults it can affect young or old male or female even children can have sleep apnea a problem more common than once thought certain factors can put you more at risk of getting sleep apnea obesity excess weight leading to an enlarged neck and excess soft tissue in the trachea enlarged adenoids and or tonsils airway can become blocked when tonsils or adenoids are too large sex and age older men are more likely to suffer from sleep apnea than women are drinking alcohol sedates the throat muscles and causes them to collapse cigarette smoking which inflames the upper airway while death is obviously possible due to obstructive sleep apnea and subsequent lack of breathing there are many very serious effects that while not fatal are most certainly severe even when it is not fatal sleep apnea deprives the body of essential oxygen and hence overall blood oxygen levels are reduced and concurrently carbon dioxide levels rise this can lead to toxic buildup that can cause heart disease stroke and brain damage here is what you will learn in the sleep apnea e-book introduction categories of sleep apnea signs and symptoms diagnosis of sleep apnea how to diagnose sleep apnea with sleep studies children with sleep apnea treatments for sleep

that doesn't make promises that it will fail to deliver on this app does not promise you will reach a certain fitness level in a certain amount if time instead companion exercise makes the following promise you will improve your fitness level aided by the tools in companion push up companion exercise is premised on a few simple ideas there is no set workout other apps give you a certain workout and expect you to continue attempting that workout until you successfully complete it this is discouraging and encourages your muscles to grow lazy as they get used to the particular set instead companion exercise dynamically changes its sets to match your fitness level seems simple but nobody else does it actually one app does ask you if it was too hard just right or too easy but that requires you to define your own fitness level multiple types of workouts again every other app has a certain set that you have to work through before you can move on companion exercise has multiple types of workouts so your muscles never get used to a workout and grow lazy muscle confusion technique if you want to look it up don't like a particular workout simply go into the preferences and deselect it you will no longer have to do that particular one fog of war concept its sad when you finish a workout e g a run and realize that you had extra energy but its too late once you have finished the workout unless you start again obviously companion exercise eliminates that problem by not telling you how much of your workout you have left by not knowing if this is the last set you can try your hardest on every set and be satisfied that you won't have any extra energy at the end track your progress companion exercise includes with graphs so you can see your improvement over the days weeks and months it will even track your personal records and notify you when you have bested yourself notifications i'm lazy and i realize that that's why i built my app to have customizable notifications when that alarm dings i know its time to exercise ease of entry i know i don't want to be interrupted while doing my workout i have optimized the interface so that along with the

that specific exercises can help you to improve the appearance of your penis designed to increase your testosterone and hgh levels dl and squat exercises in particular are rumoured to produce temporary gains amongst trainers yet is there any truth to this myth well it is easy to see why this myth existsfor starters there are numerous treatments on the market which claim to increase your penis size by boosting your natural testosterone and hgh levels by boosting your hgh in particular this is believed to encourage cell replenishment and growth meaning your penis too could experience additional gains however you can only take such theories with a pinch of salt after all the larger you are physically the smaller your penis will look in comparison so how can i improve my penis size whilst exercising and training wont do you any harm in fact training can improve your stamina levels we wouldnt advise using this method alone especially as your hormone levels are not that simple to control to experience real lasting gains the simplest way to improve your penis size is to use a penis extender applying traction to the corpora cavernosa in your penis the tubes responsible for holding blood when your penis is erect this causes cells to break away from the walls and duplicate as these cells increase in mass they enable your penis to hold more blood achieve harder erections reduce premature ejaculation and penile curvatures but more importantly can add inches to your penis in one recent study of men after wearing the device for  hours a day over months the participants experienced average gains of cm erect and cm flaccid which remained months after they completed the study and with the right penis extender you can experience similar results just make sure before you buy that they can provide you with the following clinical studies not generic studies but a clinical study that has been specifically done on their device guarantee the longer the money back guarantee the more confident they are that their device works simply make sure it is longer than months most penis extenders need months in order to achieve maximum results quality materials top penis extenders are made from medical type materials and use comfort way technology and mda technology to ensure comfort and freedom from chaffing no matter the shape size angle or sensitivity of your penis pick the right penis extender and you can experience more than a myth but real visible gains simply remember to do your research and pick the right device for you more information on some of the other methods

thousands of lean young men the dream is to gain weight but no matter how much they eat they remain thin some people are naturally thin that means their genetic makeup is in such a way that the body burns more calories than others the very basic method of weight gain is to eat more calories than your body burns off by providing the body with more calories this balance can be altered and body mass can be increased weight training is of great importance in this context which enables the body to absorb more nutrients from the food by increasing the level of certain hormones and increasing the muscle mass there are many incorrect beliefs and theories about building muscle the type of food to be eaten is an important factor which decides the type of weight gained whether it is muscle mass or mere accumulation of fat some types of calories are not equal to others for gaining muscle because most processed junk food contains empty totally nutritionless calories these foods promote accelerated fat storage and do not provide the body with the correct nutrients essential for gaining muscle high quality protein which the body breaks down into amino acids should be the centerpiece of all your meals intense exercise increases demand for amino acids which support muscle repair and growth another factor is the selection of the right type of weight training resistance exercises will help with muscle growth whereas aerobic exercises can result in the reduction of weight for maximum muscle gain the focus of your workouts should consist of free weight exercises rather than machines or bodyweight exercises to get a very effective workout you must stimulate as many muscle fibers as possible and machines do not do this the results of weight training can vary from person to

teenagers healthy eating for people over sixty healthy eating for infants there are few things as controversial as exactly what constitutes healthy eating everyone wants to eat more healthily and producers of food want their customers to believe that whatever theyre selling will help them do that somewhere along the line the truth gets lost in the noise in objective terms most nutritionists agree that the best path to healthy eating is to eat all the different food groups in moderation these means to avoid fad diets that restrict one food group and go overboard with another and not to eat too much of whatever your favourite food might be the key is to eat some carbohydrate protein and fat at each meal hopefully balancing out things like pasta and rice with meat or other fats and proteins however it is also necessary to restrict calorie intake which basically means not eating too much overall how many calories you need varies depending on your gender how old you are and what kind of work you do but somewhere between  calories per day works as a general rule a more controversial part of the drive towards healthy eating is that some food ingredients are generally considered to be unhealthy in any quantity and the big food manufacturers arent happy about this because these ingredients tend to be cheap or tasty or useful or all three preservatives are a good example as are pesticides and sweeteners and consumers attempts to avoid these have led to manufacturers being forced to go to all sorts of lengths to remove them from their foods governments have got in on the healthy eating act too with many of them mounting campaigns on it in an effort to drive down obesity and other food-related conditions the most common one is the message to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables per day which has led to a marketing feeding frenzy with other campaigns including anti-salt pro-oils anti-trans fats and sometimes anti-junk food in general so go ahead and grab your

asanas and relaxation techniques as well as learning more about the hatha yoga philosophies hatha yoga  the yoga of postures what most people refer to as simply yoga is actually the real hatha yoga hatha yoga is a system of yoga introduced by yogi swatmarama a yogic sage in the th century in india this particular system of yoga is the most popular one and it is from which several other styles of yoga originated including power yoga bikram yoga ashtanga yoga and kundalini yoga the word hatha comes from the sanskrit terms ha meaning sun and tha meaning moon thus hatha yoga is known as the branch of yoga that unites pairs of opposites referring to the positive sun and negative moon currents in the system it concentrates on the third asana and fourth pranayama steps in the eight limbs of yoga hatha yoga tries to achieve balance between body and mind as well as attempts to free the more subtle spiritual elements of the mind through physical poses or asanas breathing techniques or pranayama and meditation asanas are various body positions designed to improve health and remove diseases in the physical causal and subtle bodies the word asana is sanskrit for seat which refers not only to the physical position of the body but also to the position of the body in relation to divinity the regular practice of hatha yoga asanas will grant the practitioner muscle flexibility and bone strength as well as non-physical rewards such as the development of will power concentration and self-withdrawal pranayama is derived from the words prana life-force or energy source and ayama to control it is the science of breath control this is an important part of hatha yoga because the yogis of old times believed that the secret to controlling one's mind can be unlocked by controlling one's breath the practice of pranayama can also help unleash the dormant energies inside our body the practice of hatha yoga can help you recognize your hidden physical and mental potentials through the continued performance of asanas you will gain flexibility and strength and learn to be more relaxed under otherwise stressful situations hatha yoga's relaxation exercises will open the energy channels which in turn allows spiritual energy to flow freely some hatha yoga poses also massage and tone your internal organs helping to prevent diseases such as diabetes arthritis and hypertension they also bring balance to internal and glandular functions pranayama on the other hand can help manage asthma and bronchitis hatha yoga can also help you cope with stress relieve tension and deal with anxiety and depression more importantly it will help you put your mind in a focused state to prepare for meditation and eventually the search for enlightenment hatha yoga asanawith ha meaning sun and tha meaning moon hatha yoga is commonly translated as the yoga that brings union of the pairs of opposites sometimes hatha yoga is also translated as the forcefull yoga because it requires a lot of physical effort hatha yoga is certainly the yoga that is the best known in the west which is part of the reason why so many definitions of hatha yoga exist in the indian tradition hatha yoga is one of the four main traditions of tantra yoga hatha yoga is first of all concentrating on the practice of postures asanas and breath control pranayama to energize the subtle channels nadis thus one might say hatha yoga concentrates on the third and fourth steps of the eight-fold path of ashtanga yoga the objective of hatha yoga is obviously to remove the obstacles to address the further steps of pratyahara sense-withdrawal dharana concentration dhyana meditation and samadhi balance in many hatha yoga schools these further steps are seen as part of hatha
